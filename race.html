        TODO:
        Create JS files to populate races, classes, subclasses, all of that stuff along with their attributes and etc
        Make the website look pretty with css
        Get more basic stuff laid out
        Implement dice rolling system (probably will just be random numbers for now as physics would be more difficult to implment as one person)
        Add separate headers and such to better organize the website(ie, race picker, class, levels, abilities and stuff)
